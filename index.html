        <h1>YEO JUN PENG</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Jun Peng. I am currently an undergraduate student, majoring in Industrial design, at NUS. I have always been intrigued by the influence of technology and entrepreneurship on our society. I am passionate about design especially in the areas of user interface/user experience and Generative Design. As a designer, I hope to combine the realms of design and technology to make the world a healthier, and more sustainable place.</p>
